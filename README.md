## Typed Relational Database access in Java

### Introduction
This project is part of the [tyred](https://github.com/codr7/tyred) family of frameworks.

### Database Support
The framework is built on top of JDBC and uses standard SQL, 
which makes it relatively database agnostic. Many features are optional,
if you don't use them, the database isn't required to support them.

So far, it has been tested with [H2](https://www.h2database.com/).
